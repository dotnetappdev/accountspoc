## Use Cases

### **Scenario 1: The Remote Job Site**
*Sarah, a general contractor, arrives at a remote construction site with no cell signal. She opens the app, reviews the work order with all task details, captures photos of the completed foundation work, and marks tasks as complete. When she returns to the office and connects to WiFi, everything syncs automatically.*

### **Scenario 2: The Quick Quote**
*Mike, an HVAC technician, finishes inspecting a customer's system. Right there in the basement, he creates a detailed quote with multiple line items, sets an expiry date, and emails it to the customer—all from his phone. The quote is saved locally and will sync with the office system later.*

### **Scenario 3: The Job Completion**
*Lisa wraps up a painting job. She takes before-and-after photos, links them to the work order, has the customer review the work on her tablet, and marks the job complete. All documentation is captured and secured immediately.*
